Maven Hospital Challenge is Maven Analytics current challenge. I play an Analytics Consultant for Massachusetts General Hospital. This challenge asked me to build a key performance indicators (KPI) dashboard so the hospital's stakeholders can understand the hospital's recent performance in key areas, and answer the following questions:

    How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
    How long are patients staying in the hospital, on average?
    How much is the average cost per visit?
    How many procedures are covered by insurance?
*/

/*
The data provided information on ~1k patients and 47.7k procedures at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2011-2022. Multiple tables in this dataset cover information like patient demographics, insurance coverage, and medical encounters and procedures.
*/


Questions I'm asking
1. How many patients have been admitted between 2011 and 2022?
2. How many patients were readmitted?
3. How long on average are patients staying in the hospital?
4. What is the average cost per visit?
5. How many procedures are covered by insurance?
6. Does the number of procedures and cost increase with the patient's age?
7. What is the average number of visits per age?
8. What is the average cost of a visit per age?
